# Helix Logs
A logger for the Helix roleplaying framework written in Node.js with Typescript.

If you enjoyed my project, consider adding a star ‚≠ê or checking out my server [Aurora HL2RP](https://aurorahl2rp.com), which has used this tool at scale and in production before its release.

- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

> **Note on editors!** - TypeScript has great support in [every editor](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links), but this project has been pre-configured for use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!

# Deployment
To deploy the app to a web server, simply set it to production and add your own website domain.
> IP addresses work too, but you should use a domain to be able to use Cloudflare's DDoS protection).

SSL is strongly recommended, you can combine Cloudflare's full (strict) HTTPS with a self signed certificate using openssl for full end-to-end encryption.

# Docker for advanced users (Optional)
If you would like to use Docker, then create an .env file first like instructed above and then run the following command:
```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
You'll be able to access the website by http://serveriphere:3000 or if you reverse proxy your domain to port 3000.

# Debugging
Type `npm run debug` in your terminal to perform a full build and then server the app in watch mode. `npm run watch` if you are not using static assets.
> VS Code lets you easily run npm scripts from the editor
